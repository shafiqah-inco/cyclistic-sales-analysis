## 1st Case Study of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate
#### Shafiqah Arif - 9 June 2025

### Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

### Business Task
1. The goals to strategize converting casual riders into annual members
2. Understand how annual members and casual riders differ
3. Analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends
4. Design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Google BigQuery SQL (Data extraction & cleaning)
